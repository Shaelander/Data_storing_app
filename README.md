# Data_storing_app
I created this small app for Mind Grind Pvt.LTD to record their daily Work Sessions 

This repository contains all the app code as well as the fully compiled application stored in the dist folder

The purpose of this application was to store records electronically and remove paperwork.

Application fully satisfies the requirements for what it was designed.
